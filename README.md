My name is Diana and I love coffee. 
I prefer Espresso but I don't think everyone enjoys it as much as I do. I have had Cuban Coffee which is the strongest espresso I've ever had (couldn't sleep for a day or two) which is saying something. It's probably not good for my heart but everyone has their weakness.
